## Feature files

The `features` dir contains Cucumber feature files that describe high level features.  New featues 
should usually start as a new feature file with only a `Feature` section, then some discussion 
should take place to reach agreement about exactly what the new feature is.  `Scenario` sections should
be written for each use case or edge case that can be identified.  Finally code should be written to 
make each scenario pass.
